# Multimodal Learning Resources

This repo aims to gather and organize a variety of resources, including papers, tutorials, datasets, code examples, and community links, all in one place.
## What is Multimodal Learning?
Multimodal learning involves integrating information from different modalities such as text, images, audio, video, and more. By combining multiple data types, systems can learn richer representations and perform tasks like image captioning, speech-driven gesture recognition, audio-visual scene understanding, and beyond.
